==== USB HOST TODOLIST ====

* MCU thread:
	- Read data stream from MCU
	- Send start signal
	- Send stop signal
	- mmap() output file?

* FPGA thread:
	- Send data stream to FPGA
	- mmap() dataset
	- Send start signal
	- Send stop signal

* Add documentation for entire codebase!
	- Not necessary to explain how everything works (only if it does something very hacky)
	  but ensure that every functions has a line or two about _what_ it does.

* TODO: Add more TODO items to this list.

==== IF WE HAVE TIME ====

* Make the program more portable. Especially the Makefile
